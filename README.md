# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit card approvals using logistic regression. The model will help automate the evaluation process of credit card applications, which is often mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains a mix of numerical and non-numerical features, values from different ranges, and a number of missing entries.

## Project Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

1. **Loading and Viewing the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded and initial observations are made.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to build intuitions about the dataset.
4. **Model Building**: A logistic regression model is built to predict whether a credit card application will be approved.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `credit card approval using logistic regression.ipynb` to see the step-by-step implementation.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have a working model that can predict credit card approvals based on various applicant features. This automated system can significantly reduce the time and effort required in the manual evaluation process.
